# Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Cryptocurrency Clusters

This project involved unsupervised learning, which utilized several clustering algorithms to explore whether cryptocurrencies can be grouped together with other similar cryptocurrencies. Further, for this project, I completed steps as follows. 

### Data Preparation

1. Read crypto_data.csv into Pandas. 

2. Discarded all cryptocurrencies that are not being traded.

3. Removed all rows that have at least one null value.

4. Filtered for cryptocurrencies that have been mined.

5. Converted all data to numeric values.

6. Standardized the dataset so that columns that contain larger values do not unduly influence the outcome.

### Dimensionality Reduction

7. Performed dimensionality reduction with PCA.

8. Reduced the dataset dimensions with t-SNE and visually inspect the results.

### Cluster Analysis with k-Means

* 9. Created an elbow plot to identify the best number of clusters.

### Recommendation

* 10. Provided recommendations.
